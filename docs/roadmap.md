# Cairn Web UI — Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-06-01 · **Last status refresh:** 2026-08-10
**Status:** living document — see [Live status](#live-status--2026-08-10) for the
current board; the phase narrative below is kept as design history.

This is the decomposition and ordering plan for `tau-rs/cairn-web-ui`, the
web-tech UI for [Cairn](https://github.com/tau-rs/cairn). Each phase gets its
own `spec → plan → build` cycle, mirroring how the engine repo was built
(walking skeleton first, everything else a proven seam).

## Context

Cairn's Rust engine is a transport-blind hexagon exposing one async contract:
**commands** (mutations), **queries** (reads), and a push **event stream**.
The generated TypeScript bindings at `tau-rs/cairn/crates/cairn-contract/bindings/`
are the source of truth this UI imports.

**The engine "gap" — now closed (update 2026-06-01):** the engine session
shipped ADR-0002 (`tau-rs/cairn` @ `079f9f9`): `cairn-service` (a transport-blind
dispatcher — `dispatch_command` / `dispatch_query` / `app_event_to_wire`) and
`cairn-daemon` (HTTP transport). The contract now includes the response DTOs
(`CommandResponse`, `QueryResponse`, `ContractError`, `NoteSummary`, `GraphEdge`)
and `list_notes` / `get_graph` queries. ADR-0002 explicitly assigns Tauri to the
UI session ("the UI session wires Tauri by calling `cairn-service` in-process"),
validating this roadmap. Phases 0–1 still build against a `MockClient` (no
running engine needed); Phase 2 is now pure UI-side wiring, no engine work.

## Locked decisions

- **Transport target: Tauri-first.** The engine runs in-process behind Tauri
  IPC — the spec's *primary shell*: offline-first desktop, the everyday personal
  note-taking experience. The daemon (HTTP/WS, for browser/remote/multi-device)
  is a genuinely-secondary later add-on.
- **Design for both modes.** The UI is written against a single
  transport-abstracted `CairnClient` interface with swappable implementations
  (`MockClient`, `TauriClient`, `DaemonClient`). The React app never knows which
  transport it is on; transport is a single composition-root choice. Supporting
  both Tauri and daemon is therefore a design property, not extra work.
- **Engine-gap ownership: resolved — the engine already closed it** (ADR-0002:
  `cairn-service` + `cairn-daemon`). No UI-side engine work remains for Phase 2.

## Proposed stack (mirrors `tau-rs`/tau-web-ui)

React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind 3 + Zustand + react-router-dom,
`@xyflow/react` for the graph view, Vitest + Testing Library for unit/component
tests, Playwright for e2e. pnpm. Tauri v2 added at Phase 2.

## The `CairnClient` seam

```ts
interface CairnClient {
  sendCommand(c: Command): Promise<CommandResponse>;  // rejects with ContractError
  runQuery(q: Query): Promise<QueryResponse>;         // rejects with ContractError
  subscribe(cb: (e: Event) => void): Unsubscribe;
}
```

(`CommandResponse` / `QueryResponse` / `ContractError` are the real vendored
contract DTOs from `tau-rs/cairn`, not invented here.)

Implementations:
- `MockClient` — in-browser fake over a fixture cairn (Phases 0–1, dev/test).
- `TauriClient` — Tauri IPC + event channel (Phase 2, wired first).
- `DaemonClient` — `fetch` + WebSocket (later, zero UI changes).

## Phases

| Phase | What | Depends on | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Scaffold** ✅ done | Vite + React + TS + Tailwind + Zustand app. Vendored contract TS types. `CairnClient` interface + `MockClient` + fixture cairn. CI. | — | this repo |
| **1 — Walking-skeleton UI** ✅ done | Vertical slice on the mock: open a cairn, note list, open/edit a markdown note, search, backlinks panel, commit button, live refresh from the event stream. | 0 | this repo |
| **2 — Real transport** ✅ done | `TauriClient` (wraps `cairn-service` in-process) + Tauri v2 desktop shell + open-a-cairn picker (persist + auto-reopen); mock↔real switch isolated to `makeBackend`. Mobile target scaffolded (open-on-mobile deferred). | 1 | this repo |
| **3 — Editor depth** ✅ done | Rendered GitHub-README-style markdown (GFM + Tailwind Typography + code highlighting) is the DEFAULT view; CodeMirror source is the secondary "Edit source" mode; clickable `[[wikilinks]]` (resolved-by-stem). `editorMode` = `rendered`\|`source`. `[[wikilink]]` autocomplete in source and frontmatter rendering shipped in PR #50. | 1 | this repo |
| **4 — Graph view** ✅ done | `@xyflow/react` force-directed (`d3-force`) whole-cairn graph in a center-pane toggle; click node → opens note; live-refreshes on note events. *Deferred:* local/neighborhood graph. | 1 | this repo |
| **5 — Shell polish** ✅ done | Command palette, keyboard shortcuts, dialog host, `Settings`/`SettingsDialog`/`DaemonSettings`. | 1 | this repo |
| **6 — UI-plugin host** ✅ done | Iframe-sandboxed plugin host: broker (`pluginBroker`/`pluginBrokerHost`), permission prompts, slot/widget rendering, tier-3 contributions (`IframeHost`, `PermissionPrompt`, `SlotRenderer`, `WidgetView`, `PluginCapability`). | 3–5 | this repo |
| **7 — Tau actions** ⏸ gated | Surface `AgentRuntime` actions (summarize, find-related, …) once tau firms up — engine seam is still `NullRuntime`. External dependency. | 2 + tau | this repo + engine |
| **8 — Live-collab + recovery UI** 🟡 next | Surface engine epic A: CRDT collab sessions, the recovery surface (`Recover`/`Recoverable`), restore-to-new-block. Not started (`recover-lost-work-ui` branch is a stale snapshot, 0 ahead). | pin-resync ✅ + engine A ✅ | this repo |

**Critical path:** 0 → 1 → 2. Phases 3–8 fan out from the skeleton and can
reorder freely.

**The only real dependency edge left is pin-resync → Phase 8.** Everything else
is independent or done. There is no multi-wave DAG here, which is *why* this
board is a plain status doc and not a self-perpetuating rolling-handoffs pipeline
(status board + handoff protocol + auto-emitting handoff template): that
machinery earns its keep on a wide graph of blocked lanes feeding each other, and
would be pure ceremony over the ~4 flat, mostly-independent lanes above. When a
future frontier *does* fan out into many dependency-ordered lanes across parallel
workspaces, reach for that pattern then; until then, keep this board honest and
verify live repo state (both repos) before trusting any older roadmap snapshot.

## Deferred decisions

- ~~Engine-gap ownership~~ — resolved: the engine closed it (ADR-0002).
- Daemon transport + `AuthPolicy` defaults (`cairn-daemon` exists; wiring a
  `DaemonClient` + auth is its own later sub-project).
- Whether mobile (Tauri v2) is in scope and when.
- Codegen tooling for the real transport (`ts-rs` as-is vs `tauri-specta`/`rspc`
  to generate command wiring too).
